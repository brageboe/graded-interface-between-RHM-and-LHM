# Graded interface between a right-handed medium (RHM) and a left-handed medium (LHM)
This code was used to obtain the figures in my article "Analytical and Numerical Studies of Oblique Wave Incidence on Impedance-Matched Graded Interfaces between RHM and LHM Media" (open access at doi:10.2528/PIERM21112701).

We study an electromagnetic wave as it propogates in a normal right-handed medium (also known as a positive-index medium) and into a left-handed medium (also known as a negative-index medium), where there is a graded and smooth transition between the two media. In a right-handed medium, the electric permitivitty and the magnetic permittivity is positive-valued and thus behaves as most everyday materials. In a left-handed medium, the two quantities (permittivity and permeabilty) are negative-valued. LHM behave vastly differently than RHM, most noteably is that in LHM light is refracted in an opposite angle of what one would expect for a RHM. Another feature of LHM is that the electromagnetic wave propagates in opposite direction of how it would propagate in a RHM, or speaking in physics terms, the sign of the wave vector is reversed. In Figures 1-2 of the article, we see the wave as it travels from left to right over such a transition.
